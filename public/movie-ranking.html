<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO AFN</h1>
<h2>My Top Four Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Kimi No Nawa (Your Name)</h3>
<p>For me this is the best anime movie i've ever watch. The scenes, the plot, the story, the characters, everything is perfect. I highly recommend it even to people that don't really watch/like anime.</p>
<h3>Edge Of Tomorrow</h3>
<p>I watched this action movie when i was in highschool, probably. Until now, i haven't watched action movies as exiting/good as this movie. For those of you who like watchin action/sci-fi movies, i highly recommend it.</p>
<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>Well, the movie is really simple. The story is also kinda mid, but beside of that i like this movie because it was so touching. This movie really made me cry, laugh, and feel all the emotions that there trying to deliver.</p>
<h4>Paranoman</h4>
<p>This is the OG stop motion movie. I watched it when i was in middle school and i really liked it. There are a lot of good animation movies out there. But to me, this is my childhood. The movie is about a "freak" boy who can see "the dead".</p>
